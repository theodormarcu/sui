## Download Sui

In order to obtain the Sui source code, follow the steps to download (`git clone`) the `sui` repository
at [Install Sui](../build/install.md#source-code).

## Send pull requests

Start by creating your own fork of the repo:
```bash
gh fork https://github.com/mystenlabs/sui.git # or alternatively, clone your fork
cargo install --path sui/sui # put Sui CLI's in your PATH
cd sui
cargo build --all --all-targets # check that build works
cargo test # check that tests pass
```

To submit your pull request:

1. Make your changes in a descriptively named branch.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.
3. Ensure your code builds and passes the tests: `cargo test`
4. Make sure your code passes the linters and autoformatter: `cargo clippy --all --all-targets && cargo fmt --all`
5. If you have made changes to APIs, update the relevant documentation, and build and test the developer site.
6. Run `git push -f origin <branch_name>`, then open a pull request from the Sui GitHub site.
