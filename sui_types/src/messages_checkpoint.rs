    The checkpoint messages, structures and protocol: A gentle overview
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    Checkpoint proposals:
    --------------------

    Authorities operate and process certified transactions. When they have
    processed all transactions included in a previous checkpoint (we will
    see how this is set) each authority proposes a signed proposed
    checkpoint (SignedCheckpointProposal) for the next sequence number.

    A proposal is built on the basis of a set of transactions that the
    authority has processed and wants to include in the next checkpoint.
    Right now we just list these as transaction digests but down the line
    we will rely on more efficient ways to determine the set for parties that
    may already have a very simlar set of digests.

    From proposals to checkpoints:
    -----------------------------

    A checkpoint is formed by a set of checkpoint proposals representing
    2/3 of the authorities by stake. The checkpoint contains the union of
    transactions in all the proposals. A checkpoint needs to provide enough
    evidence to ensure all authorities may recover the transactions
    included. Since all authorities need to agree on which checkpoint (out
    of the potentially many sets of 2/3 stake) constitutes the checkpoint
    we need an agreement protocol to detemrine this.

    Checkpoint confirmation:
    -----------------------

    Once a checkpoint is determined each authority forms a CheckpointSummary
    with all the transactions in the checkpoint, and signs it with its
    authority key to form a SignedCheckpoint. A collection of 2/3 authority
    signatures on a checkpoint forms a CertifiedCheckpoint. And this is the
    structure that is kept in the long term to attest of the sequence of
    checkpoints. Once a CertifiedCheckpoint is recoded for a checkpoint
    all other information leading to the checkpoint may be deleted.

    Reads:
    -----

    To facilitate the protocol authorities always provide facilities for
    reads:
    - To get past checkpoints signatures, certificates and the transactions
      associated with them.
    - To get the current signed proposal. Or if there is no proposal a
      hint about which trasnaction digests are pending processing to get
      a proposal.
